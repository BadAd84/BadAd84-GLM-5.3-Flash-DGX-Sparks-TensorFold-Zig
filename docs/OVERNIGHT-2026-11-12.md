# OVERNIGHT-2026-11-12.md - what the night measured

spark1-3, TP=3, GLM-5.3-Flash EXL3 4bpw, `scripts/bench-arm.sh` (a fresh boot per level, `streams.py` prose, 400
tokens, 3 rounds), drafts on unless a row says otherwise. Images: `pin` is the clean pin (`glm53-zig:pin9c9`),
`fix4` the stack through 0039, `fix5` the stack through 0041. Cells are on spark1 under `~/bench/<arm>/`.
Tables are `scripts/cells.py` output: mean aggregate tok/s over a cell's rounds.

## 1. The owner's method, restated with what was missing

| step | arm | P1 | P2 | P4 | P6 | P8 | digests |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| stock | `pin-drafts` | 51.38 | 58.16 | 72.26 | 95.19 | 115.18 | stock |
| stock + the one env switch that matters | `pin-pad` (`TF_GLM_KDA_PAD=1`) | 64.23 | 70.92 | 84.01 | 107.91 | 129.99 | the pad's |
| stack through 0041 | `fix5` | 51.01 | 59.84 | 81.04 | 110.38 | 135.75 | stock |
| stack through 0041 + the pad | `f5-pad` | 63.94 | 74.66 | 93.28 | 124.59 | 150.80 | the pad's, equal to `pin-pad`'s |
| production (Python, its own numerics) | `pyprod` | 81.73 | 89.22 | 117.98 | 114.78 | 131.28 | its own |

- The pad is +25.0 / +21.9 / +16.3 / +13.4 / +12.9% on the clean pin. It is the pin's own switch. Production's dense
  numerics are 4-bit by its own launchers (`TF_GLM_DENSE=q4`), so pad on is the like-for-like setting.
- On top of the pad, the patch stack adds -0.5 / +5.3 / +11.0 / +15.5 / +16.0%: nothing at one stream, the gain is
  all in concurrency.
- Against production with the pad: -21.8% at one stream, -16.3% at two, -20.9% at four, then +8.5% at six and
  +14.9% at eight.

`pyprod` is the mean of its three rounds a level (P6's rounds span 111.0 to 122.3).

## 2. Defects found and fixed (patches 0040 and 0041)

- **The pad was broken in the stack, not in the pin.** Patch 0003 had replaced the pin's row sizing; through 0039
  the pad returned 4 digests for 2 prompts and 8 for 4, and measured 56.59 / 69.77 / 87.83 / 119.63 / 132.46.
  Through 0041 it returns one digest a prompt and the row above.
- **The stack through 0039 dies on a long prompt with the drafter loaded.** `f4-long` (a 10,929-token prompt, one
  stream): `ended ... reason=error (BadPair) prompt=10929 tokens=0`, then `rank 0: rank 2 stopped (BadPair); this
  rank stops too`. Through 0041 the same request runs (`f5-long`, 56.45 tok/s).
- Fourteen more restorations, read from the code and not exercised by these cells: `docs/PATCH-AUDIT.md`.

## 3. A warm turn's first token: 0007's keeps at any row are bit-exact and worth 22x at this size

| prompt | arm | P1 tok/s | P2 tok/s | first token of a repeated prompt | digests |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| about 3.6k tokens | `pin-mid` | 45.21 | 48.68 | 1,428 ms | - |
| about 3.6k tokens | `f5-mid` | 53.40 | 60.80 | 64 ms | equal to the pin's |
| about 10.9k tokens | `pin-long` | 50.63 | 54.94 | 617 ms | - |
| about 10.9k tokens | `f5-long` | 56.45 | 55.95 | 64 ms | DIFFER (section 4) |

The pin resumes a repeated prompt from the last 2,048-row grid point and runs the rest again; the stack resumes at
the prompt's own last row. The aggregate tok/s differences in this table are that first-token time, not decode.

## 4. Open defect: the stack's paired prompt step is not bit-equal to the pin's

One stream, the 10.9k-token prompt, the reply's digest:

| image | drafter | pairing on | `TF_GLM_PROMPT_PAIR=0` |
|---|---|---|---|
| pin | off | `d0b0076e1126` | `d0b0076e1126` |
| pin | on (the pin never pairs then) | `d0b0076e1126` | - |
| fix5 | off | `34deaa541eee` | `d0b0076e1126` |
| fix5 | on | `bfe55367a26a` | `d0b0076e1126` |

The pin's pair equals chunk-at-a-time; the stack's does not, and its reply also changes with the drafter, which a
correct prompt pass cannot do. Chunk-at-a-time on the stack matches the pin, so until the cause is fixed a serve
that must match the pin on long lone prompts sets `TF_GLM_PROMPT_PAIR=0`.
